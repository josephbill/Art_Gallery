### DOM 
Document Object Model is a programming interface for web projects 
This DOM represents the structure of the document as a tree of nodes : 
A node corresponds to a part of the doucment (e.g. elements <div> <h6> .... , attributes : ref, href, style, id....., text <p>Content</p>)

With JS we can manipulate the DOM to change the content , structure and style of a web page dynamically

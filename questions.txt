1.  swap the values of two variables, you can either use a third 
(temporary) variable and perform the swap directly without using a third variable.

let a  = 4 
let b = 10 

console.log(a) = 10 
console.log(b) = 4

2. Given three integers a, b, and c, determine the maximum value among them. 
(variable use , conditionals and logic operators)

let a = 3 
let b = 7 
let c = 5 

output : 7
